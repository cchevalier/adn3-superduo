### User Feedback

1.  Your Boss says: "It's important to always use an API key when you can. Get your own API key and put it into the strings.xml file."  
        
    A personal API key shouldn't put in strings.xml or any other file that is made public (for instance commit to Github). Instead it's recommended to set it in local.properties (non committed file) and use Gradle feature to set it in due time

3.  Moizeé says: “I have trouble navigating and understanding this app. It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."
    
4.  Jennie says: “I like the functionality of this app, but I hate having to open it up every time I want to check for a new game. Can’t you put something on the home screen for us?”
